Step 1: Start with a Mobile-First Base
Begin by writing your default CSS targeting small screens (e.g., smartphones). This ensures simplicity and performance.

Later, enhance styles for larger screens using media queries. This is the mobile-first approach recommended in responsive design best practices.
Step 2: Define Your Breakpoints
Choose points in your layout where the design needs to change—for example, when content begins to look cramped or misaligned.

Common breakpoints include:

max-width: 600px – smartphones

max-width: 992px – tablets

min-width: 1200px – desktops
(These are typical starting points—you can adjust based on your content.)

Step 3: Apply Media Queries to Adjust Styles
Here’s how media queries modify layouts:

For layout columns: Switch from multi-column on desktop to stacked layout on narrow (mobile) screens.


For navigation menus: Change from horizontal to vertical orientation for easier mobile navigation.


Hide or show elements: Remove less critical parts (like sidebars) on mobile for a cleaner view.

Adjust font sizes: Make text more readable on smaller or larger screens.


Example Workflow
Imagine a simple layout with content columns and a sidebar:

Base styles (mobile-first)

Single-column layout

Stacked menu

Larger, touch-friendly fonts

Tablet adjustments (max-width: 992px)

Columns split into two

Menu possibly more compact

Desktop enhancements (min-width: 1200px)

Multi-column layout

Sidebar visible

Larger font sizes or space

Step 4: Use Flexible Units & Techniques
Use relative units like percentages, em, or rem to allow layouts to flex naturally.
For typography, consider using rem units for sizing, and adjust the root font-size via media queries for fluid scaling across devices. That ensures optimal readability during screen rotations or size changes.
